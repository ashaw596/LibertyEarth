# Initiative towards Collaborative Society 

The Vision: Technically Empower People to Collaborate Better

### Challenges We Face

![](images/challenges.png)

## Why this Vision

IMHO, it is how people communicate their thoughts and how people are organized to deliver the biggest assets of human civilization. 

Technologies like AGI and blockchain are the byproducts/tools. Organizations like company and government are the forms/means. 

It is how everyone is valued and matched, to take ownership to develop, under aligned interest and agreed principles, that matters more. 

See more at the [Manifesto](manifesto.md).

## What Do We Do

Building an enterprise is one of the best ways to accumulate resources to empower people to be visionaries. As a community member with ownership (universal basic income + equity), we can focus on what's important, to build a corporation as a government (society), to best liberate everyone's productivity, to eventually create abundance for better tomorrow.

- Who: everyone who wants to be part.
- How: collaborate as a community, a corporation, a society.
- What for: liberate productivity to create abundance. 


### First Step

It sounds like a hopeless optimistic ideal. But it's possible and I'm making it feasible. Smarter minds like you can join force with [my roadmap](#how-do-we-do), or propose a better path.


We will collaborate on building tools and methodologies for ourselves, other companies, corperations, governments to communicate efficiently and effectively. 


## How Do We Do

### [A Toy Plan to Collaborate](Execution.md)

Remember, remember, the principles to be a member. 

- Autonomy
    - Social Contracts
    - Code of Conduct/Principles
        - We are a family, community, crowd-owners of a social company with diversity.
	- Trust first, but keep track of what happens.
        - Be bold, look for radical solution!
        - Be modest, `I know that I know nothing`.
        - Be honest and embrace changes, open source and open management based on credibility.
- Open Source, no NCA, NDA
    - Open Meeting
    - Open Decision
    - Open Development
- Open Management
    - Peer Review
    - Jury Decision
    - Liquid Democracy

`One can make the shape, but it is all together that can fill the gap.`
