## Why This Vision

__Domi's Story__

In my humble opinion, it is `how people communicate their thoughts and how people are organized to deliver` the biggest asset of human civilization. 

Technologies like `artificial general intelligence` and `blockchain` are the byproducts (tools). Organizations like `corporations` and `governments` are the forms (means). 

It is how everyone is valued and matched, to take ownership to develop, under aligned interest and agreed principles, that matters more.

### The Root Cause

__Domi's Thoughts__

Fundamental Trend: Larger educated populations are more frequently generating denser information through communication. 

- more information: larger networks with bigger population connected;
- faster generation: better connectivity with devices having more efficient human-computer interface;
- higher density: more intense competition drive deeper domain specified skills and experience through higher education. 


The Dilemma: Our adaptability (learning ability) are biologically limited, as

- limited attention (information I/O);
- limited computingï¼ˆinformation processing).


Direct Consequences: Information Overload that results in divergent cognitive abilities:

- bias from selection effect over the process of learning; 
- redundant information rephrased from different sources that occupied limited attention;
- conflicting information that causes recursive cognitive processing cost.


In together with the `institutional barriers` detailed below, causes 

- personal `anxiety` of `career lock-in` due to solidified skill and experience with new tools and methods flushing in;
- `sociological segregation` due to difficulties to trace the source of divergence:
    - `fragmentation of Internet` that intensifies alienation;
    - expediting `economic segregation` that raises concerns;
    - democracy failure that discouraged voters with abusive attention occupation of marketing campaign and cognitive cost to identify fake news (bad faith);
    - collaboration difficulty to resolve global challenges without __effective communication__ with __comprehensive information__ and __constructive organization__ practical in larger scale. 


I believe `diversity` is `liberal` and `collaborative`, not discriminative or alienating. 


__Cause of `Institutional Barriers`__


The [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market) is supposed to optimize the supply and demand without intervention. But information asymmetry naturally exists, which inspired capitalism to take advantage to build `institutional barriers`. Such institutional barriers include, but not limited to military (politics, policies, ideologies), economics (capitals, market power, information), technology (patents, IPs, manufacturing techniques). 

The economic and sociological segregations are then rationalized with [Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism) for the favor of politicians, capitalists, institutions that also fosters religionists, nationalists, racists, sexists, etc.

Any minority faces [inequality bargaining power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_of_bargaining_power) due to the information asymmetry caused by `institutional barriers`.



My abstraction of `Industrial Revolution` & `Renaissance`:

1. Printing: Enlightenment, less rational barrier due to geographic isolation.
2. Mechanization, steam power: Industrial Revolution 1.0, more productivity with less labor dependency.
3. Publishing: Romanticism, less educational barrier due to sociological status.
4. Mass production, electricity: Industrial Revolution 2.0, more productivity with less gender, age, physical status dependency.
5. Transportation, telegram: Darwinian, less information barrier due to transportation efficiency.
6. Computer, automation: Industrial Revolution 3.0, more productivity with less economic status dependency. 
7. Internet, communication technology: Marketism (Capitalism/Socialism with market adaption), less information barrier due to social network limit.  
8. Artificial general intelligence, adaptive learning, general purpose robotics: Industrial Revolution 4.0, more productivity with less skill, knowledge dependency.
9. Smart social contract, social identity & credit system: Collaborative society, less opportunity barrier due to sociological status.

## What Do We Do

Building an enterprise is one of the best ways to accumulate resources to empower people to be visionaries. As a community member with ownership (universal basic income + equity), we can focus on what's important, to build a corporation as a government (society), to best liberate everyone's productivity, to eventually create abundance for better tomorrow.

- Who: everyone who wants to be part.
- How: collaborate as a community, a corporation, a society.
- What for: liberate productivity to create abundance. 


### First Step

It sounds like a hopeless optimistic ideal. But it's possible and I'm making it feasible. Smarter minds like you can join force with [my road map](#how-do-we-do), or propose a better path.


We will collaborate on building tools and methodologies for ourselves, other companies, corporations, governments to communicate efficiently and effectively.

### How To Participate?

Anyone should be a part of the collaborative society, which aims to provide help to liberate everyone, with equal access to the information and basic resources, until catching up by adaptive learning, to become capable, to extend the edge of the collective knowledge base.

## How Do We Do

### [A Toy Plan to Collaborate](Execution.md)

Remember, remember, the principles to be a member. 

__Principles__

- Autonomy
    - Social Contracts
    - Code of Conduct/Principles
        - We are a family, community, crowd-owners of a social company with diversity.
	- Trust first, but keep track of what happens.
        - Be bold, look for radical solution!
        - Be modest, `I know that I know nothing`.
        - Be honest and embrace changes, open source and open management based on credibility.
- Open Source, no NCA, NDA
    - Open Meeting
    - Open Decision
    - Open Development
- Open Management
    - Peer Review
    - Jury Decision
    - Liquid Democracy

`One can make the shape, but it is all together that can fill the gap.`


## What To Expect

In the big picture, guided by the Principle:

- A beautiful future to work towards.
- A meaningful purpose to live on.
- A community with trusted like-minds.
- A stage to liberate your talents.

In the short term, detailed in [Execution Plan](Execution.md#A-spice-about-the-economic-scence):

- Peace of mind with universal basic income.
- A share of equity matched to your added value.

Nothing is perfect but in Principles we unite. [QA thread](https://github.com/domijin/LibertyEarth/issues/3#issue-427262167).


### What's the future I expect?

- What's the Future of Manufacturing?
    - Can it be `on-demand`? Will there be less material cost and inventory?
    - Can it be `made local`? Will there be less packaging and energy cost in logistics?
    - Can it be `specialized to customization`? Is choice abundance and personal affiliation a unfulfilled demand?
    - Can I 
        - choose the fashion design, fit to body, print at local hub, pick up to go?
        - land in airport, pick up socks, travel, recycle the socks, fly out?
        - take chargers to re-engineer for new devices?
    - What's not in the `Cost`?
        - Externalities: do we miss out the waste, recycle cost in the price model?
        - Responsibility: we change from ownership to adoption for pets, should we also care for goods? 
- What's the Future of Education?
    - Can we learn more efficiently?
        - Can it be more `Adaptive`? Can information density be adjusted to the personal knowledge base?
        - Can it be more `Practical`? Can we learn from practice with the guide of the collective knowledge base?
    - What's the purpose of education?
        - Is it a necessity in the future of material abundance?
        - Can I just be curious to question until the edge of the collective knowledge base?
- What's the Future of Work? 
    - Do we need to be skilled when there is artificial general intelligence? 
    - Will there be income gap when experience of best practice can be supplemented by collective knowledge base?
    - What's the purpose of work in the Future of Manufacturing?
        - Do we still need to work to survive?
        - Can I be creative instead of productive when the demand is specialized?
- What's the Future of Society?
    - Is it safe to trust a person knowing one's principles?
    - Is it more trustworthy showing people one's principles?
    - ...
