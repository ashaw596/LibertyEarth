# Initiative towards Collaborative Society 

The Vision: Technically Empower People to Collaborate Better

### Challenges We Face

![](images/challenges.png)

## Why this Vision

IMHO, it is how people communicate their thoughts and how people organize to deliver the biggest assets of human civilization. 

Technologies like AGI and blockchain are the byproducts/tools. Organizations like company and government are the forms/means. 

It is how everyone is valued and matched to take ownership to develop that really matters, following on aligned interest and principles. 

See more at the [Manifesto](manifesto.md).

## What Do We Do

Building an enterprise is just one of the best ways to accumulate resources to empower people to be visionaries. As a community member with ownership (UBI + equity), we can focus on what's important, to build a corporation as a government (society), to best liberate everyone's productivity, to eventually create abundance for better tomorrow.

- Objective: everyone who wants to be part.
- How: collaborate as a community, a corporation, a society.
- What: liberate productivity to create abundance. 

### First Step and _teardown how_

It sounds like a hopeless optimistic idealism. But it's possible and I'm making it feasible. 

I'm currently the founder of [MindWave X](https://mindwave.business), and support [changeTOC](http://changetoc.org). When it comes down to product-market fit, it can be flexible. It doesn’t matter to start with a hardware company, a SaaS product, or even a science fiction book picturing the future of work, life, and society. I have the roadmap and would like to make the first steps, until smarter minds like you find this out and join force. 

We will collectively try and iterate. When we have the motivation to collaborate and execute. We will do the engineering work, until we have resources to be financial free. Then, diversity on what to empower people to collaborate for, like the mentioned [challenges](#Challenges-We-Face), will and shall emerge to create abundance for better tomorrow. 


## How Do We Do

Remember, remember, the principles to be a member. 

- Autonomy
    - Social Contracts
    - Code of Conduct/Principles
        - We are a family, community, crowd-owners of a social company.
	- Trust first, but keep track of what happens.
        - Be bold, look for radical solution!
        - Be modest, `I know that I know nothing`.
        - Be honest and embrace changes, open source and open management based on credibility.
- Open Source, no NCA, NDA
    - Open Meeting
    - Open Decision
    - Open Development
- Open Management
    - Peer Review
    - Jury Decision
    - Liquid Democracy

## One More Thing

`I know that I know nothing` -- Socrates

- [Current Open Projects](https://github.com/domijin/LibertyEarth/projects)
	- Ideation with Q&A: happening at [issues](https://github.com/domijin/LibertyEarth/issues)
	- [ ] A better walk-through of the vision, wording, language, etc.
	- [ ] Disclose the road-map towards collective society.
	- [ ] Test and iterate the [execution plan](Execution.md).
	- Better Name of the Project and a Website.
