# Initiative towards Collaborative Society 

The Vision: Technically Empower People to Collaborate Better

### Challenges We Face

![](images/challenges.png)

## Why this Vision

How people communicate their thoughts and how people organize to deliver the biggest assets of human civilization. 

See more at the [Manifesto](manifesto.md).

## What Do We Do

Technologies like AGI and blockchain are the byproducts/tools. Organizations like company and government are the forms/means. 

It is how everyone is valued and matched to take ownership to develop that really matters, following on aligned interest and principles. 


Building an enterprise is just one of the best ways to accumulate the resources to empower people to be visionary. As a community member with ownership, we can focus on what's important. A corporation as a government (society) to best liberate everyone's productivity to create abundance. 

I'm currently the founder of [MindWave X](https://mindwave.business), and support [changeTOC](http://changetoc.org). But when it comes down to product-market fit, it can be flexible. It doesn’t matter to start with a hardware company, a SaaS product, or even a science fiction book picturing the future of work, life, and society. 


When we collectively figure out the MVP, engineering work will still be essential but we will have the motivation to collaborate and execute. When we have the financial freedom and resources, diversity on what to empower people to collaborate on will and shall emerge to make the world better, like the mentioned [challenges](#Challenges-We-Face).
