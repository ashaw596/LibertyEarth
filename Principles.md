## Principles in Construction

Remember, remember, the principles to be a member. 

- Autonomy
    - Social Contracts
    - Code of Conduct/Principles
        - We are a family, community, crowd-owners of a social company with diversity.
	- Trust first, but keep track of what happens.
        - Be bold, look for radical solution!
        - Be modest, `I know that I know nothing`.
        - Be honest and embrace changes, open source and open management based on credibility.
- Open Source, no NCA, NDA
    - Open Meeting
    - Open Decision
    - Open Development
- Open Management
    - Peer Review
    - Jury Decision
    - Liquid Democracy

`One can make the shape, but it is all together that can fill the gap.`


### Openness and Trustworthy

My Two Cents

- Open Source
   - Self-awareness: I know what I know. 
   - Self-confidence: I admit what I don't know. 
   - Self-challenge: I embrace to learn what I don't know. 
- Open Management
   - Team-awareness: nothing new under the Sun. What cannot tell is what cannot improve.
   - Team-confidence: ideas can be stolen but minds cannot. The more to share gets the more to admire.
   - Team-challenge: one long leg doesn't make a stable table. Keep people informed to land informed decisions.
- Open Equity
    - Social-awareness: we stand on the shoulder of giants. `Nothing comes from nothing.` 
    - Social-confidence: with giants we stand. Share with the team is multiplying the power. 
    - Social-challenge: `more power comes with more responsibility. ` Share with the market is exponentiating the world. 

`Superorganism` is the ultimate form of `Effective Altruism` to archive `Co-Prosperity`.
