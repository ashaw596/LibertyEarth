        - Be modest, `I know that I know nothing`.

### Openness and Trustworthy

My Two Cents

- Open Source
   - Self-awareness: I know what I know. 
   - Self-confidence: I admit what I don't know. 
   - Self-challenge: I embrace to learn what I don't know. 
- Open Management
   - Team-awareness: nothing new under the Sun. What cannot tell is what cannot improve.
   - Team-confidence: ideas can be stolen but minds cannot. The more to share gets the more to admire.
   - Team-challenge: one long leg doesn't make a stable table. Keep people informed to land informed decisions.
- Open Equity
    - Social-awareness: we stand on the shoulder of giants. `Nothing comes from nothing.` 
    - Social-confidence: with giants we stand. Share with the team is multiplying the power. 
    - Social-challenge: `more power comes with more responsibility. ` Share with the market is exponentiating the world. 

`Superorganism` is the ultimate form of `Effective Altruism` to archive `Co-Prosperity`.
